May 27, 2009 an open source runtime environment was released. Node js revolutionized server-side applications and made countless impossibilities a reality. Now there is a new kid on the block. <h2>Who is this new kid you speak of? ü§î</h2> <!--truncate--> <a href="https://bun.sh/"> Bun </a>
(and before you ask yes all the cool names have already been taken üòÖ ) is a new open source runtime environment created by <a href="https://jarredsumner.com/">Jared Sumner</a> and over 40 contributors. This nerdy looking runtime environment really packs a punch.
According to its creator it was made to: <ol><li>Start fast</li> <li>Have new levels of performance</li> <li>To be a great and complete tool.</li></ol>  
On its beta release it's creator made a claim to be the an increadibly fast all all-in-one JavaScript

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Bun - an incredibly fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. <a href="https://t.co/Yt6tAcnBQs">https://t.co/Yt6tAcnBQs</a></p>&mdash; Jarred Sumner (@jarredsumner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1544460933753229312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> runtime.

## How fast you ask? üöÄ
Here are the benchmark performances of Bun in comparision to Node js and Deno.

Take a moment to soak in those number. And yes its legit well atleast according to <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> they are . It is not looking good for deno but i am sure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl">Ryan Dahl</a> and the team at deno have somethng up their sleeve.

## How does it work? ‚öôÔ∏è
Well Node Js uses googles <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8 engine</a> and has made it a great tool because of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdk-java-technology/8?topic=reference-jit-compiler">JIT (Just In Time) compilation</a>. Now Bun uses the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore">JavaScript Core </a> which is considered to be faster. It was also written in a low level language <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> which is like C and Rust had a baby. Low level control of memory and lack of hidden control flow are the features of Zig that make Bun as fast as it is

## Features üìã 
<ul>
<li>
Native bundler that replaces Web Pack
</li>
<li>
Transpiler that enables TypesScript to be written out of the box
</li>
<li>
Task runner
</li>
<li>
npm client
</li>
<li>
Automatically loaded environment variable (bye bye require("dotenv").load()).
</li>
<li>
Native Test runner
</li>
<li>
90% of the Node Api functions
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bun.sh/">
and more</a>
</li>
</ul>

I don't think it can get better than this.<br></br>
It is worth noting that since its a new tool it will be buggy. It will be best to use a WSL ( Windows Subsystem for Linux)

The introduction of Bun will definitely be a dream come true for many developers. However will this tool stand the test of time or become the next Windows 8. Hopefully not.
